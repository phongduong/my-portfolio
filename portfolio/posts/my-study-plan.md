So far, I have learned new tools and programming languages by building projects. But I think I can learn more by sharing the process I develop projects. This may include blog posts and Youtube videos. 

With blog posts, I am going to share what I learn from developing projects and the knowledge I gained from it. I create short tutorial for every project.

With Youtube videos, I am going to record the process I build projects. Because I have a full-time job and part-time bachelor degree so I will try to publish content once a month.

Update: I quit my job and will create Youtube videos full-time. Check out and subscribe my channel to get more tutorial about programming
