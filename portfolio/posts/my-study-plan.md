So far, I have learned new tools and programming languages by build projects. But I think I can learn more by sharing the process I develop projects. This may include blog posts and Youtube videos. 

With blog posts, I am going to share what I learn from developing projects and the knowledge I gained from it.

With Youtube videos, I am going to record the process I build projects. In videos and posts, I will share how I use new tools or programming languages to develop projects. I try to publish once per month.
