I develop Color Bubbles for UDGJ#2. After polishing and editing, it is available and free to play on Play Store now. It also has a web version on itch.io. 

It is a simple game with green and pink bubbles. You rotate the bar to make same colors touch each other and prevent pink bubbles touching green bubbles.
