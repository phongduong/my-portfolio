In 2019, I did a lot of interesting things:

* Start and shut down my company KOOGIO
* Begin game development and publish 3 games on Google Play
* Begin my blog
* Start a new job

In 2020, there are some goals I want to archive:

* Begin mobile development
* Continue travelling because in 2019 I didn't travel much
