Js13kGames has started on 13th August. This is a competition for HTML5 game developers. The interesting part of it is the entry size is limited to 13kb. I intent to participate in it and makes some games. I think this is a great opportunity to learn Typescript. I wanted to learn it but I didn't find any ideas to build using it. So I think I can use Typescript for this competition.
