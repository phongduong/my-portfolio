I had an idea about a game. I thought about it when I take courses about Game Development. The courses were provided by Michigan State University. Those course were great. I just enrolled 3 courses but it was amazing. They provided knowledge about game development and business. They were very useful.

Although the course provide game development knowledge by using Unity, I can translate the knowledge to Phaser. I was looking for game engines to build my HTML5 game and I found Phaser. It has understand and well-formatted document. It also has tutorials to help you develop your game if you get stuck.

The most thing I love about Phaser is it supports Facebook instant game. I am trying to develop my instant game. I develop and deploy my game on browser first to receive users feed first. I create [Tapping Shapes](https://tapping-shapes.surge.sh/) from simple shapes like circle and square. It is easy to play. I hope it will gain some users to give me some feedback before I start developing instant game version. I hope you will have fun with my game. You can play Tapping Shapes [here](https://tapping-shapes.surge.sh/).
