I heard about js13k last year while I was reading Javascript Weekly newsletter. I thought it was fun to develop a game using Javascript. But at that time, I didn't have any experience about game development so I didn't join it. 

This year, I began my game development journey with the first game [Tapping Shapes](https://tapping-shapes.surge.sh/) using Phaser. It was quite difficult when I start using stuffs like sprite sheet, sound.... After that, I switched to using Defold engine and learning Lua to develop games. 

When this year js13k competition started, I planned to develop 2 games for it. I used KontraJS to develop. I thought developing games with KontraJS would be easy as I used Defold. But it is not. Defold is simple and it supports many features helping developer develop game faster. KontraJS is a lightweight library but it doesn't support so much features like Defold so I had to hand-coded. There was a constraint that every entry's size must be under 13kb.

I developed 2 games [Coiner ](http://js13kgames.com/entries/coiner)and [Luon](http://js13kgames.com/entries/luon). I limited my self using 4-color palette for game graphic. Because of the game's constraint, I couldn't use heavyweight assets like sprite sheet or sound for the games. Luckily, Canvas and Web Audio made my life easier and kept games size was under 13kb. 

By developing 2 games with so much constraints like size and colors, I believe that I can do anything in my life with constraints. **Nothing is impossible.**
