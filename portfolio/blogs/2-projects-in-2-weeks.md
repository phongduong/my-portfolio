  I have an idea about a platform that helps users rent books. I am quite a
  bookworm. I read a lot so that there are many books on my bookshelf.
  Unfortunately, my bookshelf does not have enough space to store all my books.
  So I think I will rent books and make some money while I have more space on
  the bookshelf.


  I began developing an application that helps me rent my books. I released an
  MVP of my project after 2 weeks and got no user in first days. A user
  commented on my Facebook page that my amount of books was poor. So I plan to
  turn the application in to a platform with 2 application. It works like a
  marketplace. An application that allows user rent books and another manages
  books. 


  I developed them in 2 weeks and deployed them today. I do not know whether it
  will any user will use my platform to rent books or not. But it will help me
  solve the problem with my books.


  These are my applications
