# Hi, I am Phong Duong

I am a full-stack developer from Vietnam. I have started my developer journey from 2016. My main stack is Javascript full-stack currently. I also focus on Progressive Web App and JAMstack technologies. I am interested in experimenting new things and using them to create funny projects. I am a kinesthetic learner so that I like learning by creating things. I figure out that I learn faster by building things and reading documents simultaneously.

As a part of my learning process, I want to share my knowledge to everyone. I create this blog to share writing tutorials. I write about different topics from game development, web development to desktop and mobile development. There are some posts I share the personal things like lessons I learned in my life or I goals I set myself. I also create Youtube channel to share my tutorials to people who prefer learning by watching videos.
