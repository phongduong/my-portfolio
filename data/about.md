# Hi, I am Phong Duong

I am a full-stack developer. I have started my developer journey since 2016. My main stack is full-stack Javascript currently. I also focus on Progressive Web App and JAMstack technologies. I am a kinesthetic learner so that I like learning by creating things. I figure out that I learn faster by creating things and reading documents simultaneously.

* I create [this blog](http://phongduong.dev/blog) to share writing tutorials. I write about different topics, mostly in web development. There are some posts I share personal things like lessons I learned or the goals I set myself.
* I create [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXykqt3V2-9bYXKWZRcH0rA) to share tutorial videos. 
* I also live code on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/koogio).
* I create [a weekly newsletter](https://koogio.substack.com/) to share useful content that I consume every week. It sometimes includes my videos and blog posts. I send it out every Saturday.
