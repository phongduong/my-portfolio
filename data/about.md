# Hi, I am Phong Duong

I am a full-stack developer from Vietnam. I have started my developer

journey from 2016. My main stack is React, Vue and Nodejs currently. I

also focus on Progressive Web App and JAMstack technologies.

I am interested in experimenting new tools and using them to create funny

projects. I am a kinesthetic learner so that I like learning by creating

things. I figure out that I learn faster by building things and reading

documents simultaneously.

As a part of my learning process, I want to share my knowledge to

everyone. I create this blog to share writing tutorials. I write about

different topics from game development, web development to desktop and

mobile development. I also create Youtube channel to share my tutorials to

people who prefer learning by watching videos.
