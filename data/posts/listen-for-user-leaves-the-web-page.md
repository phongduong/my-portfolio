To know when users leave the web page, you listen to `beforeunload`**.**Â This event is fired before the `window` is unloaded. 

There are some ways to show the dialog, it depends on the browser's support.

In the event handler, you can call `preventDefault()` on the event, assign a string to the event's `returnValue`Â property and return a string. You can combine these methods if your web page runs on multiple browsers.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  event.returnValue = '';
});
```
