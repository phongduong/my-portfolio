[KOOGIO](https://koogio.now.sh/) is an indie game studio. I create it to learn game development. Beside that, I also create a collection of projects to learn new tools and advertise [KOOGIO](https://koogio.now.sh/). This collection includes static website, wep app, mobile app, API server, desktop app. 

Every project in [this page](https://phongduong.github.io/koogio/#/) includes tools I used, tools were new to me when I built projects.
