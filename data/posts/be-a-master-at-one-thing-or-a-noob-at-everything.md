I am a developer. My main programming language is Javascript. Actually, I have learned and used some programming languages for personal and professional projects.

When I began learning programming, I spent time looking for which programming language is the best for me. I read the description, pros, cons and the reason why it was the best. I searched tutorials and sites like Codecademy, Treehouse to learn code. 

I also enrolled programming courses. I tried to learn every programming language I was suggested such as Java, C, Python, Javascript and Ruby. I learned concepts like variable, function of programming languages. At the end, I only learn a little because those concepts are similar no matter what the programming language.
