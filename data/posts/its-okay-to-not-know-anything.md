There are many fields in programming. Each field contains many topics. We can't learn and know all of them. 

As a developer, I want to learn new frameworks and libraries. But there are many frameworks and libraries created every day. Learning all of them is impossible.

When I started learning web development, I wanted to learn all tools that I was suggested, from programming languages to libraries. Because I thought I would become a professional developer. This made me feel nervous because I can't keep up with the releasing pace. 

After I joined a company as an intern, I was assigned to a PHP project. Although I worked with PHP, I also wanted to learn other programming languages and tools my company was using. 

The situation continued until I found out about Node.js. I decided I would stick with it and be a full-stack Javascript developer. Because I was tired and lazy.
