There are many fields in programming. Each field contains many topics. We can't learn and know all of them. 

As a developer, I want to learn new frameworks and libraries. But there are many frameworks and libraries created every day. Learning all of them is impossible.

When I started learning web development, I wanted to learn all tools that I was suggested, from programming languages to libraries. Because I thought I would become a professional developer. This made me feel nervous because I can't keep up with the releasing pace. 

After I joined a tech company as an intern, I was assigned to a PHP project. Although I worked with PHP, I also wanted to learn other programming languages and tools my company was using. I thought I could be fired if I couldn't use them. 

Fortunately, I got the developer job and continued working on this project for almost 1 year. I was also assigned to some PHP projects. Some of them were written 3 - 4 years ago. I only maintained and updated some minor features. It made me realize that although the technology changed rapidly, the projects did not. Companies didn't want to upgrade to the latest versions of technologies. If the project was working well, there is no reason to change.

At that time, I also knew about Node.js. It was really interesting. You can write Javascript on both front-end and back-end. I decided I would stick with it and be a full-stack Javascript developer. Because I was tired and lazy. I was tired because I try to learn so many things but not use them much. I was lazy because the time was not enough for me. So I wanted to focus on only one thing. This was better.
