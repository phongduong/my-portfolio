Building CSS code includes multiple steps like compiling preprocessors, transforming CSS with PostCSS, minify to reduce size and rename file for production version. I will show you how to build pure CSS code. I don't use preprocessor or transform CSS. I only minify, rename and bundle code to output directory.
