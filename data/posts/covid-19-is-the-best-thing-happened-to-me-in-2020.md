2020 is a weird year. In the New Year, I had a list of plans. I believed it would be a great year and I could complete all my plans. 

Suddenly, COVID-19 came and everything changed. I heard news about death everyday. People around me lost their job or had pay cut.

Everything was still fine to me. I was lucky to keep my job and get full salary. I didn't have to work from home. 

I like learning and creating new things. I have a lot of ideas and personal projects I want to create. The list is getting longer everyday. But I procrastinated to work on my project. After my full-time job, I was exhausted. I tried to work a bit every night. Someday I didn't do anything. My project had a little progress but I almost felt like giving up.

 One day, my grandpa got sick and almost died. I thought I may lost him. Fortunately, he recovered and be in good health now. After this event, I wanted to have more time with my grandpa as well as my family. 

I also thought about me. What if one day I never get up and do things I want? Maybe it is tomorrow.
