Hyperapp is a fast and lightweight front-end framework. It can help you build your project or MVC quickly.

Electronjs is a framework that allows you to build a desktop application using HTML, CSS and JS. It means you can combine Hyperapp with Electronjs

I create a video that will help you learn how to create an application with Hyperapp and bundle it into a desktop application with Electronjs
