Have you ever looked for something on Google but can't find what you expected? I experienced this situation many times. 

If I were stuck at a problem, I would search for the solution on Google. Sometimes I didn't find the solution for my problem. I wondered whether any solution existed or any people knew the solution. 

I believe that there is someone knows the solution but they don't share it. I was that person before. I knew something that was valuable to people but I was afraid to share it. I thought people may shared it before and my solution was redundant. 

But things have changed. Recently, I have begun creating tutorials and sharing them with everyone. I realized that sharing is a another way to learn. When I create a tutorial about a concept, I will learn the concept and understand it more. It also makes me more creative because there are many ways to create a tutorial. It may be a blog post, a video or an image with my code using Carbon.

Sharing is also a way to save knowledge. Programming is large and I can't remember everything. So my blog is the first source I will use when I am stuck.

I believe that we have different experiences in our life. Even though we experience a same thing, we still have different perspectives on how it effects to our life. So don't be afraid to share something you know. It will be valuable to someone
