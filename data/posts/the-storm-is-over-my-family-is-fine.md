This morning, a storm just surfed through my city. In just 15 minutes, it damaged a lot. Trees are broken and fell down. The roof of a house flew to my yard. Fortunately, no one got injured. We lost electricity. My parents went out while the storm were coming and I worried about them.
The storm is over. Now everything is fine. We are cleaning our house. My parents come back and be normal. We have electricity.ï»¿
