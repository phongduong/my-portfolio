Creating content is the best way to build your online presence, share knowledge, and marketing your product. There are many formats of content: videos, blog posts, images, stories, streams, you name it.

When I started creating content, I usually asked myself what format I should create and what type of content people would like. I continued asking myself and didn't create anything.

But it had changed when I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVKofRN1dyI). Gary's idea was so brilliant: you document your life. You do what you like and share it with the world instead of creating something from the void. I liked this idea so much.

It's been 4 months since I started creating content. In this post, I am going to share some tips I use to create content on some popular platforms. I [write blogs](https://phongduong.dev/blog/), [make videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXykqt3V2-9bYXKWZRcH0rA), [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/koogio), and [publish a weekly newsletter](http://koogio.substack.com/).

## Bundle and unbundle

You can bundle the content you consumed and created into a newsletter and publish it. You can even bundle your content into a book or a course. The most thing I like about creating content is that you can split a piece of content into pieces of content with different contexts.

## Consume other's content

If you want to create more content, you should consume more content. The process is continuous. You can give creators compliments or have new ideas for your content from what you consumed. You can bundle the consumed content for your newsletter or share it on platforms.    

## Your creativity

If the tips above can work for you, that's great! Don't worry if they don't. There are no right or wrong answers. You are a unique piece of content. Your knowledge, experiences, and thoughts can be shared and helped people. Keep trying and you will find your way. Believe me. 

## Summary

In this post, I shared some tips you can use for creating content. It is not rocket science. You can share what you know, experiences, or thoughts. You will find the content format and medium that work for you. Keep trying and don't be afraid of failure.

> People can't read or watch your content but at least they still see you. That's enough
