Creating content is a useful way to build your online presence, share knowledge, and marketing your product. There are many formats of content: videos, blog posts, images, stories, streams, you name it.

When I started creating content, I usually asked myself what format I should create and what type of content people would like. I continued asking myself and didn't create anything.

But it has changed when I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVKofRN1dyI). Gary's idea was so brilliant: you document your life. You do what you like and share it with the world instead of creating something from the void.

I liked this idea so much.

It's been 4 months since I started creating content. I am on some popular platforms. I create my own blog, Youtube channel, stream on Twitch, and publish a weekly letter.

In this post, I am going to share how I am creating content and some tips you can use to create more content.
