4 months ago, I didn't imagine what I am doing now. I had some social network accounts but I wasn't active on these platforms. I hid and consumed content passively. Sometimes I just liked the content I found interesting and scrolled down.

But it has changed when I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVKofRN1dyI). The idea was so interesting: you document your life and create content about you. I liked the idea and wanted to create my own content.

At that time I didn't have any know what type of content I should create. There are a lot: videos, blog posts, images, stories, streams, etc...
