Creating content is the best way to build your online presence, share knowledge, and marketing your product. There are many formats of content: videos, blog posts, images, stories, streams, you name it.

When I started creating content, I usually asked myself what format I should create and what type of content people would like. I kept asking myself and didn't create anything.

But it had changed when I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVKofRN1dyI). Gary's idea was so brilliant: you document your life. You do what you like and share it with the world instead of creating something new from the void. I liked this idea so much.

It's been 4 months since I started creating content. In this post, I am going to share some tips I use to create content on some popular platforms. I [write blogs](https://phongduong.dev/blog/), [make videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXykqt3V2-9bYXKWZRcH0rA), [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/koogio), and [publish a weekly newsletter](http://koogio.substack.com/).

## You are the unique piece of content

Your knowledge, experiences, and thoughts are unique pieces of content. They are valuable to someone out there. They can help people around you. You can create notes of what you are learning and doing. This is also a good way to learn and build in public. Communities like [\#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysofCode), [Dev.to](http://dev.to/), an Indie T are the best places to share your progress. If you are reading a useful blog post or watching an interesting video, please share it with people. If it can help you, it also helps people.

## Bundle and unbundle

When you make notes, you can turn them into a blog post later. You can also take quotes from a blog and post it to platforms. I think this is the most amazing aspect of creating content. It's like you are playing Lego. You take small pieces and create another big piece. You can also break the big piece into small pieces.   

## Consume other's content

If you want to create more content, you should consume more content. The process is continuous. You can give creators compliments or have new ideas for your content from what you consumed. You can bundle the consumed content for your newsletter or share it on platforms.    

## There is no right or wrong answer



## Your creativity

If the tips above can work for you, that's great! Don't worry if they don't. There are no right or wrong answers. You are a unique piece of content. Your knowledge, experiences, and thoughts can be shared and helped people. Keep trying and you will find your way. Believe me. 

## Summary

In this post, I shared some tips you can use for creating content. It is not rocket science. You can share what you know, experiences, or thoughts. You will find the content format and medium that work for you. Keep trying and don't be afraid of failure. If you have anything that you like and want to share with the world, don't hesitate to do it.  

> People can't read or watch your content but at least they still see you. That's enough
