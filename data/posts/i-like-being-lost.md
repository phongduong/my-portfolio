I usually travel on the weekend. I don't use map while traveling because I don't want to spend money on mobile data and focus on my trip. So I sometimes get lost. 

The most interesting thing about being lost while travelling is that I have to find a way to the destination. There are many ways to a destination and I am free to choose one. I can also ask local residents. 

Due to being lost, I have to change my plan and the destination.
