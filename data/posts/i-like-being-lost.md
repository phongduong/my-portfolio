I like traveling without map because I am free to choose a way to go. There are many ways to the destination. I can also ask local residents for the way. This is interesting if I travel abroad. I communicate with people who don't speak the same language. If I am lucky, I can speak to whom speak English. Else, I have to use gestures to communicate with them. Fortunately, they understand me and show me the correct way.

Sometimes I have to change my plan due to being lost. Although I don't get to the destination as I planned, I have a chance to visit new place. I learn new things like how people live and work there. No matter where I go, I still have something to learn
