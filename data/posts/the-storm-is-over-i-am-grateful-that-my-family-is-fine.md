This morning, a strong storm just swept through my city. In only 15 minutes, it damaged a lot. Trees are broken and fell down. The roof of a house flew to my yard. Fortunately, no one got injured. We lost electricity. My parents went out while the storm were coming and I worried about them.

The storm is over. Now everything is fine. We are cleaning our house. My parents come back and be normal. We have electricity and be preparing for the dinner.
