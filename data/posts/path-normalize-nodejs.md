Normalize path means that the `'..'` and `'.'` segments are resolved and path segment separation characters like `/` and `\` are replaced with the platform-specific path segment separator.

To normalize the path with Node, you call the `normalize()` method of the `path` module.

```javascript
 const path = require("path")
```

It receives a path as a parameter

```javascript
path.normalize("foo/bar/baz/../foo")
// foo\\bar\\foo
```

The path above is resolved at `'..'` segment. It goes up from `baz` to `bar` and continues with `foo`. I am using Windows so that the path segment separator is replaced with `\\`. 

If there are multiple separators, they will be replaced with a single separator.

```javascript
path.normalize("foo/bar/baz/////foo")
// foo\\bar\\baz\\foo
```

Â In case you combine `/` and `\` in the path, they are still replaced with a platform-specific separator.

```javascript
path.normalize("foo/bar/baz//\\/\\/foo")
// foo\\bar\\baz\\foo
```

The method preserves the trailing separators.

```javascript
path.normalize("foo/bar\\")
// foo\\bar\\
```

If you pass a zero-length string, the method return `'.'`, which is the current directory.

```javascript
path.normalize("")
// '.'
```
