You may experience the feeling of being rejected when you apply for a job. I know how it feels. It is really frustrating. As long as you keep trying, you can archive what you want.

Rejection is two sides of the same coin. It sometimes gets you frustrating and feeling giving up. But it also gives you a chance to improve what doesn't work.

Whenever you are rejected, don't be afraid to ask for feedback. People are generous to give feedback. You could know what you are good at and not.

This means that after every rejection, you will have a chance to improve something.

You should take that chance. Constructive feedback is welcome.

But how about destructive feedback? I know it's hard to deal with destructive feedback. But it's also a skill. You can learn and master it over time.

There are a lot of opportunities around you. Every opportunity contains an opportunity waiting for you. If you try all possible opportunities, you not only learn more but also could find at least one that works for you.

The more you are rejected, the more lesson you learn, the better you are.

Let's love rejection.
