I have an idea about a platform that helps users rent books. I am quite a
bookworm. I read a lot so that there are many books on my bookshelf.
Unfortunately, my bookshelf does not have enough space to store all my books.
So I think I will rent books and make some money while I have more space on
the bookshelf.

I began developing an application that helps me rent my books. I released an
MVP of my project after 2 weeks and got no user in first days. A user
commented on my Facebook page that my amount of books was poor. So I plan to
turn the application into a platform with 2 application. It works like a
marketplace. An application that allows user rent books and another manages
books.

I developed them in 2 weeks and deployed them today. I do not know whether any
user will use my platform to rent books or not. But it will help me solve the
problem with my books.

When I finished deploying 2 apps, I realize that I just spent 2 weeks to
developing them. That is incredible. Because it often takes me 2-3 weeks to
develop an app even it is just a single page app with front-end. But these
apps are full-stack apps so I think it is a new record.

These are my applications
