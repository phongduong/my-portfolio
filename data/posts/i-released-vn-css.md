It is Vietnam Nation Day today. I want to celebrate it with a css library. I was inspired by [Bennett Feely](https://bennettfeely.com/) and [Lynn Fisher](https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic). So I created patterns with css gradient. I used 2 colors on Vietnam's flag red and yellow. Check it out at [vncss.vercel.app](https://vncss.vercel.app/)
