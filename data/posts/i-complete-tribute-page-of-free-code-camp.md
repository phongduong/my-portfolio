Tribute Page is a project of Responsive Web Design certification in Free Code Camp. It requires me to create a Tribute Page that satisfies the user stories. It doesn't requires me to use Pug. I just want to challenge myself and use Pug instead of HTML to create the project.

I create a video to show how I create it
