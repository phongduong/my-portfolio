It's my birthday today. I turned 24 years old.

It also has been 3 months since I quitted my jobs and created content. I learned a lot about creating content and build audiences.

I really enjoy this journey. I am trying and improving my content day by day. I keep sharing helpful content with people.

If I make a wish on my birthday, I only wish I can keep doing what I am doing. Sometimes, it's frustrating and I want to give up. But when someone like my work and thank me. I have more confidence. It motivates me to continue.

Happy birthday to me.
