You sometimes accidentally displease people around you because you don't understand them. It's normal. You don't need to feel guilty about it. You are not Professor X. You don't have the ability to read their minds. The person who you displease also doesn't want you to feel guilty. 

If you are in this situation, just remember that you can't please everyone. Because it is going to make you exhausted. If you try to please everyone, no one is pleased.
