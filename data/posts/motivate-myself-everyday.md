Every day I get up, I find it hard to keep up the momentum. Things don't happen as I expected. When I publish a piece of content, I expect many people would consume it. But it doesn't. Although it's fun to create content and express my creativity, I'm sometimes frustrated because it doesn't get any engagement.

I have to motivate myself to keep going. I have watched an anime series recently. It's Run with the Wind. The series is about a group of 10 college students who are trying to take part in a marathon contest. They don't have any experience in running and have to run 5km in 16 minutes.
