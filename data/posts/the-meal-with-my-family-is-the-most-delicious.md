My parents go to work everyday. We only have dinner together. So it is the most precious moment of the day to me.

I always want to enjoy this moment. I try to wait for my parents until they get back home from work.

Dinner is the most delicious meal of the day. We can eat and laugh together. I ask them how their day is.
