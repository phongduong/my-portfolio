Sometimes everything doesn't happen as you expected. You may get stuck in difficult situations. You may lose your job, your house, or your family. You would get hurt and frustrated but don't give up. But you can improve your situation and make it better.

More, you can make use of difficult situations as a source of growth. They will teach you invaluable lessons.

You can view every situation as a lemon and its seeds as lessons. When life gives you one lemon, you make lemonade. You improve the situation.

But what about its seeds? After you have the seeds, you can take them to plant new lemon trees. You will harvest your own lemons. This is when you apply your lessons in difficult situations in the future. You are going to know how to solve the problem and improve it.

The more trees you plant, the large your lemon garden is. You will learn more lessons and become a better person.

> You don't need to be scared of difficult situations, just love and make use of them.
